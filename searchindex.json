Article is really usefull, i used code as is, its easy and provides all you need, but later i have some problem with it.\nFirst problem - eager evaluation. General commands for git and mercurial are calculated once. Great, there is no reason to call external process like git or hg multiple times but precalculation occured at script evaluation. You may not want to start eshell, so call hg or git is not needed.\nSecond problem - if you broke PATH variable (emacs cant find git or hg executable, or you install emacs before you install git or mercurial) than you got crash while starting emacs (not fatal but annoying emacs lisp errors).\nThats why i add some modifications.

Hhhhaaa, add this into .profile.\nBut .profile is evaluated at every launch of terminal.\nSo you have conditionally patch your environent variables, in other words .profile must be idempotent. Multiple evaluation of .profile must have same effect as single evaluation, othewise after terminal app launches several times, your PATH looks like this:\nADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH...:$PATH So final version of the script:\n# patch PATH for terminal programs # check variable hasnt already patched if [[ $PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then export PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH fi # patch PATH for gui (and spotlight in particular) # preserve old values OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # check if has not already patched if [[ $OLD_GUI_PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH fi Looks like a little bit cumbersome, but works ! If there is easier way, i would be glad to know.\nUpdate: There is problem with this solution. launchctl settings are updated during first load of .profile file. So if you has not opened terminal app yes (for example after restart), you cant use this customization.\nUpdated solution can be found here.\n","id":50,"section":"posts","summary":"Suppose you install some program into your home directory (i had installed mercurial from source). To use it you have to patch PATH variable.\nTo achieve this, you needed to modify, for example, local .profile file (its undesirable to modify global config like etc/profile).

Article is really usefull, i used code as is, its easy and provides all you need, but later i have some problem with it.\nFirst problem - eager evaluation. General commands for git and mercurial are calculated once. Great, there is no reason to call external process like git or hg multiple times but precalculation occured at script evaluation. You may not want to start eshell, so call hg or git is not needed.\nSecond problem - if you broke PATH variable (emacs cant find git or hg executable, or you install emacs before you install git or mercurial) than you got crash while starting emacs (not fatal but annoying emacs lisp errors).\nThats why i add some modifications. I preserve \u0026lsquo;precalculation\u0026rsquo; of general command list for git and mercurial using this trivial snippet:\ncache-defuns.el\n(defun cached (f) \u0026#34;evaluate once and cache it\u0026#34; (lexical-let ((value nil) (fn f)) (lambda (\u0026amp;rest args) (if (eq value nil) (progn (setq value (funcall fn)) value) value)))) (provide \u0026#39;cache-defuns) This snippet allow you to calculate function f once, and use its result at subsequent calls.\nAnother modifications connected with bad PATH variable. I dont throw exception or write message at emacs minibuffer but at time of completion corresponding error message will be printed at eshell instead of autocomplete results.

To use it you have to patch PATH variable.\nTo achieve this, you needed to modify, for example, local .profile file (its undesirable to modify global config like etc/profile). So your .profile file contains something like this:\nexport PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH It wokrs great from terminal. But you cant use variable defined such way from programs launched throught spotlight, because all apps started from gui interface of Mac Os has its own list of environemnt variables (independent from terminal). In my case i cant access mercurial from emacs launched from spotlight.\nYou can access environment variables used by gui apps in such way:\n$ launchctl getenv PATH To change it:\n$ launchctl setenv PATH $SOME_PATH Its reasonable to preserve original PATH while patching. So you want to add your $ADDITIONAL_PATH into gui PATH\n# save old path OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # construct new path NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH # update gui path launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH These changes are not persisted, so you will miss it after restart. Hhhhaaa, add this into .profile.\nBut .profile is evaluated at every launch of terminal.\nSo you have conditionally patch your environent variables, in other words .profile must be idempotent. Multiple evaluation of .profile must have same effect as single evaluation, othewise after terminal app launches several times, your PATH looks like this:\nADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH...:$PATH So final version of the script:\n# patch PATH for terminal programs # check variable hasnt already patched if [[ $PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then export PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH fi # patch PATH for gui (and spotlight in particular) # preserve old values OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # check if has not already patched if [[ $OLD_GUI_PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH fi Looks like a little bit cumbersome, but works ! If there is easier way, i would be glad to know.\nUpdate: There is problem with this solution. launchctl settings are updated during first load of .profile file. So if you has not opened terminal app yes (for example after restart), you cant use this customization.\nUpdated solution can be found here.\n","id":102,"section":"posts","summary":"Suppose you install some program into your home directory (i had installed mercurial from source).

Article is really usefull, i used code as is, its easy and provides all you need, but later i have some problem with it.\nFirst problem - eager evaluation. General commands for git and mercurial are calculated once. Great, there is no reason to call external process like git or hg multiple times but precalculation occured at script evaluation. You may not want to start eshell, so call hg or git is not needed.\nSecond problem - if you broke PATH variable (emacs cant find git or hg executable, or you install emacs before you install git or mercurial) than you got crash while starting emacs (not fatal but annoying emacs lisp errors).\nThats why i add some modifications. I preserve \u0026lsquo;precalculation\u0026rsquo; of general command list for git and mercurial using this trivial snippet:\ncache-defuns.el\n(defun cached (f) \u0026#34;evaluate once and cache it\u0026#34; (lexical-let ((value nil) (fn f)) (lambda (\u0026amp;rest args) (if (eq value nil) (progn (setq value (funcall fn)) value) value)))) (provide \u0026#39;cache-defuns) This snippet allow you to calculate function f once, and use its result at subsequent calls.\nAnother modifications connected with bad PATH variable.

To use it you have to patch PATH variable.\nTo achieve this, you needed to modify, for example, local .profile file (its undesirable to modify global config like etc/profile). So your .profile file contains something like this:\nexport PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH It wokrs great from terminal. But you cant use variable defined such way from programs launched throught spotlight, because all apps started from gui interface of Mac Os has its own list of environemnt variables (independent from terminal). In my case i cant access mercurial from emacs launched from spotlight.\nYou can access environment variables used by gui apps in such way:\n$ launchctl getenv PATH To change it:\n$ launchctl setenv PATH $SOME_PATH Its reasonable to preserve original PATH while patching. So you want to add your $ADDITIONAL_PATH into gui PATH\n# save old path OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # construct new path NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH # update gui path launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH These changes are not persisted, so you will miss it after restart. Hhhhaaa, add this into .profile.\nBut .profile is evaluated at every launch of terminal.\nSo you have conditionally patch your environent variables, in other words .profile must be idempotent. Multiple evaluation of .profile must have same effect as single evaluation, othewise after terminal app launches several times, your PATH looks like this:\nADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH...:$PATH So final version of the script:\n# patch PATH for terminal programs # check variable hasnt already patched if [[ $PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then export PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH fi # patch PATH for gui (and spotlight in particular) # preserve old values OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # check if has not already patched if [[ $OLD_GUI_PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH fi Looks like a little bit cumbersome, but works ! If there is easier way, i would be glad to know.\nUpdate: There is problem with this solution. launchctl settings are updated during first load of .profile file. So if you has not opened terminal app yes (for example after restart), you cant use this customization.\nUpdated solution can be found here.\n","id":154,"section":"posts","summary":"Suppose you install some program into your home directory (i had installed mercurial from source).

Article is really usefull, i used code as is, its easy and provides all you need, but later i have some problem with it.\nFirst problem - eager evaluation. General commands for git and mercurial are calculated once. Great, there is no reason to call external process like git or hg multiple times but precalculation occured at script evaluation. You may not want to start eshell, so call hg or git is not needed.\nSecond problem - if you broke PATH variable (emacs cant find git or hg executable, or you install emacs before you install git or mercurial) than you got crash while starting emacs (not fatal but annoying emacs lisp errors).\nThats why i add some modifications. I preserve \u0026lsquo;precalculation\u0026rsquo; of general command list for git and mercurial using this trivial snippet:\ncache-defuns.el\n(defun cached (f) \u0026#34;evaluate once and cache it\u0026#34; (lexical-let ((value nil) (fn f)) (lambda (\u0026amp;rest args) (if (eq value nil) (progn (setq value (funcall fn)) value) value)))) (provide \u0026#39;cache-defuns) This snippet allow you to calculate function f once, and use its result at subsequent calls.\nAnother modifications connected with bad PATH variable.

To use it you have to patch PATH variable.\nTo achieve this, you needed to modify, for example, local .profile file (its undesirable to modify global config like etc/profile). So your .profile file contains something like this:\nexport PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH It wokrs great from terminal. But you cant use variable defined such way from programs launched throught spotlight, because all apps started from gui interface of Mac Os has its own list of environemnt variables (independent from terminal). In my case i cant access mercurial from emacs launched from spotlight.\nYou can access environment variables used by gui apps in such way:\n$ launchctl getenv PATH To change it:\n$ launchctl setenv PATH $SOME_PATH Its reasonable to preserve original PATH while patching. So you want to add your $ADDITIONAL_PATH into gui PATH\n# save old path OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # construct new path NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH # update gui path launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH These changes are not persisted, so you will miss it after restart. Hhhhaaa, add this into .profile.\nBut .profile is evaluated at every launch of terminal.\nSo you have conditionally patch your environent variables, in other words .profile must be idempotent. Multiple evaluation of .profile must have same effect as single evaluation, othewise after terminal app launches several times, your PATH looks like this:\nADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH...:$PATH So final version of the script:\n# patch PATH for terminal programs # check variable hasnt already patched if [[ $PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then export PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH fi # patch PATH for gui (and spotlight in particular) # preserve old values OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # check if has not already patched if [[ $OLD_GUI_PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH fi Looks like a little bit cumbersome, but works ! If there is easier way, i would be glad to know.\nUpdate: There is problem with this solution. launchctl settings are updated during first load of .profile file. So if you has not opened terminal app yes (for example after restart), you cant use this customization.\nUpdated solution can be found here.\n","id":206,"section":"posts","summary":"Suppose you install some program into your home directory (i had installed mercurial from source).

Article is really usefull, i used code as is, its easy and provides all you need, but later i have some problem with it.\nFirst problem - eager evaluation. General commands for git and mercurial are calculated once. Great, there is no reason to call external process like git or hg multiple times but precalculation occured at script evaluation. You may not want to start eshell, so call hg or git is not needed.\nSecond problem - if you broke PATH variable (emacs cant find git or hg executable, or you install emacs before you install git or mercurial) than you got crash while starting emacs (not fatal but annoying emacs lisp errors).\nThats why i add some modifications. I preserve \u0026lsquo;precalculation\u0026rsquo; of general command list for git and mercurial using this trivial snippet:\ncache-defuns.el\n(defun cached (f) \u0026#34;evaluate once and cache it\u0026#34; (lexical-let ((value nil) (fn f)) (lambda (\u0026amp;rest args) (if (eq value nil) (progn (setq value (funcall fn)) value) value)))) (provide \u0026#39;cache-defuns) This snippet allow you to calculate function f once, and use its result at subsequent calls.\nAnother modifications connected with bad PATH variable.

To use it you have to patch PATH variable.\nTo achieve this, you needed to modify, for example, local .profile file (its undesirable to modify global config like etc/profile). So your .profile file contains something like this:\nexport PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH It wokrs great from terminal. But you cant use variable defined such way from programs launched throught spotlight, because all apps started from gui interface of Mac Os has its own list of environemnt variables (independent from terminal). In my case i cant access mercurial from emacs launched from spotlight.\nYou can access environment variables used by gui apps in such way:\n$ launchctl getenv PATH To change it:\n$ launchctl setenv PATH $SOME_PATH Its reasonable to preserve original PATH while patching. So you want to add your $ADDITIONAL_PATH into gui PATH\n# save old path OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # construct new path NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH # update gui path launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH These changes are not persisted, so you will miss it after restart. Hhhhaaa, add this into .profile.\nBut .profile is evaluated at every launch of terminal.\nSo you have conditionally patch your environent variables, in other words .profile must be idempotent. Multiple evaluation of .profile must have same effect as single evaluation, othewise after terminal app launches several times, your PATH looks like this:\nADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH...:$PATH So final version of the script:\n# patch PATH for terminal programs # check variable hasnt already patched if [[ $PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then export PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH fi # patch PATH for gui (and spotlight in particular) # preserve old values OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # check if has not already patched if [[ $OLD_GUI_PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH fi Looks like a little bit cumbersome, but works ! If there is easier way, i would be glad to know.\nUpdate: There is problem with this solution. launchctl settings are updated during first load of .profile file. So if you has not opened terminal app yes (for example after restart), you cant use this customization.\nUpdated solution can be found here.\n","id":258,"section":"posts","summary":"Suppose you install some program into your home directory (i had installed mercurial from source).

Article is really usefull, i used code as is, its easy and provides all you need, but later i have some problem with it.\nFirst problem - eager evaluation. General commands for git and mercurial are calculated once. Great, there is no reason to call external process like git or hg multiple times but precalculation occured at script evaluation. You may not want to start eshell, so call hg or git is not needed.\nSecond problem - if you broke PATH variable (emacs cant find git or hg executable, or you install emacs before you install git or mercurial) than you got crash while starting emacs (not fatal but annoying emacs lisp errors).\nThats why i add some modifications. I preserve \u0026lsquo;precalculation\u0026rsquo; of general command list for git and mercurial using this trivial snippet:\ncache-defuns.el\n(defun cached (f) \u0026#34;evaluate once and cache it\u0026#34; (lexical-let ((value nil) (fn f)) (lambda (\u0026amp;rest args) (if (eq value nil) (progn (setq value (funcall fn)) value) value)))) (provide \u0026#39;cache-defuns) This snippet allow you to calculate function f once, and use its result at subsequent calls.\nAnother modifications connected with bad PATH variable.

To use it you have to patch PATH variable.\nTo achieve this, you needed to modify, for example, local .profile file (its undesirable to modify global config like etc/profile). So your .profile file contains something like this:\nexport PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH It wokrs great from terminal. But you cant use variable defined such way from programs launched throught spotlight, because all apps started from gui interface of Mac Os has its own list of environemnt variables (independent from terminal). In my case i cant access mercurial from emacs launched from spotlight.\nYou can access environment variables used by gui apps in such way:\n$ launchctl getenv PATH To change it:\n$ launchctl setenv PATH $SOME_PATH Its reasonable to preserve original PATH while patching. So you want to add your $ADDITIONAL_PATH into gui PATH\n# save old path OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # construct new path NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH # update gui path launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH These changes are not persisted, so you will miss it after restart. Hhhhaaa, add this into .profile.\nBut .profile is evaluated at every launch of terminal.\nSo you have conditionally patch your environent variables, in other words .profile must be idempotent. Multiple evaluation of .profile must have same effect as single evaluation, othewise after terminal app launches several times, your PATH looks like this:\nADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH...:$PATH So final version of the script:\n# patch PATH for terminal programs # check variable hasnt already patched if [[ $PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then export PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH fi # patch PATH for gui (and spotlight in particular) # preserve old values OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # check if has not already patched if [[ $OLD_GUI_PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH fi Looks like a little bit cumbersome, but works ! If there is easier way, i would be glad to know.\nUpdate: There is problem with this solution. launchctl settings are updated during first load of .profile file. So if you has not opened terminal app yes (for example after restart), you cant use this customization.\nUpdated solution can be found here.\n","id":310,"section":"posts","summary":"Suppose you install some program into your home directory (i had installed mercurial from source).

Article is really usefull, i used code as is, its easy and provides all you need, but later i have some problem with it.\nFirst problem - eager evaluation. General commands for git and mercurial are calculated once. Great, there is no reason to call external process like git or hg multiple times but precalculation occured at script evaluation. You may not want to start eshell, so call hg or git is not needed.\nSecond problem - if you broke PATH variable (emacs cant find git or hg executable, or you install emacs before you install git or mercurial) than you got crash while starting emacs (not fatal but annoying emacs lisp errors).\nThats why i add some modifications. I preserve \u0026lsquo;precalculation\u0026rsquo; of general command list for git and mercurial using this trivial snippet:\ncache-defuns.el\n(defun cached (f) \u0026#34;evaluate once and cache it\u0026#34; (lexical-let ((value nil) (fn f)) (lambda (\u0026amp;rest args) (if (eq value nil) (progn (setq value (funcall fn)) value) value)))) (provide \u0026#39;cache-defuns) This snippet allow you to calculate function f once, and use its result at subsequent calls.\nAnother modifications connected with bad PATH variable.

To use it you have to patch PATH variable.\nTo achieve this, you needed to modify, for example, local .profile file (its undesirable to modify global config like etc/profile). So your .profile file contains something like this:\nexport PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH It wokrs great from terminal. But you cant use variable defined such way from programs launched throught spotlight, because all apps started from gui interface of Mac Os has its own list of environemnt variables (independent from terminal). In my case i cant access mercurial from emacs launched from spotlight.\nYou can access environment variables used by gui apps in such way:\n$ launchctl getenv PATH To change it:\n$ launchctl setenv PATH $SOME_PATH Its reasonable to preserve original PATH while patching. So you want to add your $ADDITIONAL_PATH into gui PATH\n# save old path OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # construct new path NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH # update gui path launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH These changes are not persisted, so you will miss it after restart. Hhhhaaa, add this into .profile.\nBut .profile is evaluated at every launch of terminal.\nSo you have conditionally patch your environent variables, in other words .profile must be idempotent. Multiple evaluation of .profile must have same effect as single evaluation, othewise after terminal app launches several times, your PATH looks like this:\nADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH...:$PATH So final version of the script:\n# patch PATH for terminal programs # check variable hasnt already patched if [[ $PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then export PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH fi # patch PATH for gui (and spotlight in particular) # preserve old values OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # check if has not already patched if [[ $OLD_GUI_PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH fi Looks like a little bit cumbersome, but works ! If there is easier way, i would be glad to know.\nUpdate: There is problem with this solution. launchctl settings are updated during first load of .profile file. So if you has not opened terminal app yes (for example after restart), you cant use this customization.\nUpdated solution can be found here.\n","id":362,"section":"posts","summary":"Suppose you install some program into your home directory (i had installed mercurial from source).

Article is really usefull, i used code as is, its easy and provides all you need, but later i have some problem with it.\nFirst problem - eager evaluation. General commands for git and mercurial are calculated once. Great, there is no reason to call external process like git or hg multiple times but precalculation occured at script evaluation. You may not want to start eshell, so call hg or git is not needed.\nSecond problem - if you broke PATH variable (emacs cant find git or hg executable, or you install emacs before you install git or mercurial) than you got crash while starting emacs (not fatal but annoying emacs lisp errors).\nThats why i add some modifications. I preserve \u0026lsquo;precalculation\u0026rsquo; of general command list for git and mercurial using this trivial snippet:\ncache-defuns.el\n(defun cached (f) \u0026#34;evaluate once and cache it\u0026#34; (lexical-let ((value nil) (fn f)) (lambda (\u0026amp;rest args) (if (eq value nil) (progn (setq value (funcall fn)) value) value)))) (provide \u0026#39;cache-defuns) This snippet allow you to calculate function f once, and use its result at subsequent calls.\nAnother modifications connected with bad PATH variable.

To use it you have to patch PATH variable.\nTo achieve this, you needed to modify, for example, local .profile file (its undesirable to modify global config like etc/profile). So your .profile file contains something like this:\nexport PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH It wokrs great from terminal. But you cant use variable defined such way from programs launched throught spotlight, because all apps started from gui interface of Mac Os has its own list of environemnt variables (independent from terminal). In my case i cant access mercurial from emacs launched from spotlight.\nYou can access environment variables used by gui apps in such way:\n$ launchctl getenv PATH To change it:\n$ launchctl setenv PATH $SOME_PATH Its reasonable to preserve original PATH while patching. So you want to add your $ADDITIONAL_PATH into gui PATH\n# save old path OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # construct new path NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH # update gui path launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH These changes are not persisted, so you will miss it after restart. Hhhhaaa, add this into .profile.\nBut .profile is evaluated at every launch of terminal.\nSo you have conditionally patch your environent variables, in other words .profile must be idempotent. Multiple evaluation of .profile must have same effect as single evaluation, othewise after terminal app launches several times, your PATH looks like this:\nADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH...:$PATH So final version of the script:\n# patch PATH for terminal programs # check variable hasnt already patched if [[ $PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then export PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH fi # patch PATH for gui (and spotlight in particular) # preserve old values OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # check if has not already patched if [[ $OLD_GUI_PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH fi Looks like a little bit cumbersome, but works ! If there is easier way, i would be glad to know.\nUpdate: There is problem with this solution. launchctl settings are updated during first load of .profile file. So if you has not opened terminal app yes (for example after restart), you cant use this customization.\nUpdated solution can be found here.\n","id":414,"section":"posts","summary":"Suppose you install some program into your home directory (i had installed mercurial from source).

Article is really usefull, i used code as is, its easy and provides all you need, but later i have some problem with it.\nFirst problem - eager evaluation. General commands for git and mercurial are calculated once. Great, there is no reason to call external process like git or hg multiple times but precalculation occured at script evaluation. You may not want to start eshell, so call hg or git is not needed.\nSecond problem - if you broke PATH variable (emacs cant find git or hg executable, or you install emacs before you install git or mercurial) than you got crash while starting emacs (not fatal but annoying emacs lisp errors).\nThats why i add some modifications. I preserve \u0026lsquo;precalculation\u0026rsquo; of general command list for git and mercurial using this trivial snippet:\ncache-defuns.el\n(defun cached (f) \u0026#34;evaluate once and cache it\u0026#34; (lexical-let ((value nil) (fn f)) (lambda (\u0026amp;rest args) (if (eq value nil) (progn (setq value (funcall fn)) value) value)))) (provide \u0026#39;cache-defuns) This snippet allow you to calculate function f once, and use its result at subsequent calls.\nAnother modifications connected with bad PATH variable.

To use it you have to patch PATH variable.\nTo achieve this, you needed to modify, for example, local .profile file (its undesirable to modify global config like etc/profile). So your .profile file contains something like this:\nexport PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH It wokrs great from terminal. But you cant use variable defined such way from programs launched throught spotlight, because all apps started from gui interface of Mac Os has its own list of environemnt variables (independent from terminal). In my case i cant access mercurial from emacs launched from spotlight.\nYou can access environment variables used by gui apps in such way:\n$ launchctl getenv PATH To change it:\n$ launchctl setenv PATH $SOME_PATH Its reasonable to preserve original PATH while patching. So you want to add your $ADDITIONAL_PATH into gui PATH\n# save old path OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # construct new path NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH # update gui path launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH These changes are not persisted, so you will miss it after restart. Hhhhaaa, add this into .profile.\nBut .profile is evaluated at every launch of terminal.\nSo you have conditionally patch your environent variables, in other words .profile must be idempotent. Multiple evaluation of .profile must have same effect as single evaluation, othewise after terminal app launches several times, your PATH looks like this:\nADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH...:$PATH So final version of the script:\n# patch PATH for terminal programs # check variable hasnt already patched if [[ $PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then export PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH fi # patch PATH for gui (and spotlight in particular) # preserve old values OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # check if has not already patched if [[ $OLD_GUI_PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH fi Looks like a little bit cumbersome, but works ! If there is easier way, i would be glad to know.\nUpdate: There is problem with this solution. launchctl settings are updated during first load of .profile file. So if you has not opened terminal app yes (for example after restart), you cant use this customization.\nUpdated solution can be found here.\n","id":466,"section":"posts","summary":"Suppose you install some program into your home directory (i had installed mercurial from source).

Article is really usefull, i used code as is, its easy and provides all you need, but later i have some problem with it.\nFirst problem - eager evaluation. General commands for git and mercurial are calculated once. Great, there is no reason to call external process like git or hg multiple times but precalculation occured at script evaluation. You may not want to start eshell, so call hg or git is not needed.\nSecond problem - if you broke PATH variable (emacs cant find git or hg executable, or you install emacs before you install git or mercurial) than you got crash while starting emacs (not fatal but annoying emacs lisp errors).\nThats why i add some modifications. I preserve \u0026lsquo;precalculation\u0026rsquo; of general command list for git and mercurial using this trivial snippet:\ncache-defuns.el\n(defun cached (f) \u0026#34;evaluate once and cache it\u0026#34; (lexical-let ((value nil) (fn f)) (lambda (\u0026amp;rest args) (if (eq value nil) (progn (setq value (funcall fn)) value) value)))) (provide \u0026#39;cache-defuns) This snippet allow you to calculate function f once, and use its result at subsequent calls.\nAnother modifications connected with bad PATH variable.

To use it you have to patch PATH variable.\nTo achieve this, you needed to modify, for example, local .profile file (its undesirable to modify global config like etc/profile). So your .profile file contains something like this:\nexport PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH It wokrs great from terminal. But you cant use variable defined such way from programs launched throught spotlight, because all apps started from gui interface of Mac Os has its own list of environemnt variables (independent from terminal). In my case i cant access mercurial from emacs launched from spotlight.\nYou can access environment variables used by gui apps in such way:\n$ launchctl getenv PATH To change it:\n$ launchctl setenv PATH $SOME_PATH Its reasonable to preserve original PATH while patching. So you want to add your $ADDITIONAL_PATH into gui PATH\n# save old path OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # construct new path NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH # update gui path launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH These changes are not persisted, so you will miss it after restart. Hhhhaaa, add this into .profile.\nBut .profile is evaluated at every launch of terminal.\nSo you have conditionally patch your environent variables, in other words .profile must be idempotent. Multiple evaluation of .profile must have same effect as single evaluation, othewise after terminal app launches several times, your PATH looks like this:\nADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH...:$PATH So final version of the script:\n# patch PATH for terminal programs # check variable hasnt already patched if [[ $PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then export PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH fi # patch PATH for gui (and spotlight in particular) # preserve old values OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # check if has not already patched if [[ $OLD_GUI_PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH fi Looks like a little bit cumbersome, but works ! If there is easier way, i would be glad to know.\nUpdate: There is problem with this solution. launchctl settings are updated during first load of .profile file. So if you has not opened terminal app yes (for example after restart), you cant use this customization.\nUpdated solution can be found here.\n","id":518,"section":"posts","summary":"Suppose you install some program into your home directory (i had installed mercurial from source).

Article is really usefull, i used code as is, its easy and provides all you need, but later i have some problem with it.\nFirst problem - eager evaluation. General commands for git and mercurial are calculated once. Great, there is no reason to call external process like git or hg multiple times but precalculation occured at script evaluation. You may not want to start eshell, so call hg or git is not needed.\nSecond problem - if you broke PATH variable (emacs cant find git or hg executable, or you install emacs before you install git or mercurial) than you got crash while starting emacs (not fatal but annoying emacs lisp errors).\nThats why i add some modifications. I preserve \u0026lsquo;precalculation\u0026rsquo; of general command list for git and mercurial using this trivial snippet:\ncache-defuns.el\n(defun cached (f) \u0026#34;evaluate once and cache it\u0026#34; (lexical-let ((value nil) (fn f)) (lambda (\u0026amp;rest args) (if (eq value nil) (progn (setq value (funcall fn)) value) value)))) (provide \u0026#39;cache-defuns) This snippet allow you to calculate function f once, and use its result at subsequent calls.\nAnother modifications connected with bad PATH variable.

To use it you have to patch PATH variable.\nTo achieve this, you needed to modify, for example, local .profile file (its undesirable to modify global config like etc/profile). So your .profile file contains something like this:\nexport PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH It wokrs great from terminal. But you cant use variable defined such way from programs launched throught spotlight, because all apps started from gui interface of Mac Os has its own list of environemnt variables (independent from terminal). In my case i cant access mercurial from emacs launched from spotlight.\nYou can access environment variables used by gui apps in such way:\n$ launchctl getenv PATH To change it:\n$ launchctl setenv PATH $SOME_PATH Its reasonable to preserve original PATH while patching. So you want to add your $ADDITIONAL_PATH into gui PATH\n# save old path OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # construct new path NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH # update gui path launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH These changes are not persisted, so you will miss it after restart. Hhhhaaa, add this into .profile.\nBut .profile is evaluated at every launch of terminal.\nSo you have conditionally patch your environent variables, in other words .profile must be idempotent. Multiple evaluation of .profile must have same effect as single evaluation, othewise after terminal app launches several times, your PATH looks like this:\nADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH:ADDITIONAL_PATH...:$PATH So final version of the script:\n# patch PATH for terminal programs # check variable hasnt already patched if [[ $PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then export PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH fi # patch PATH for gui (and spotlight in particular) # preserve old values OLD_GUI_PATH=`launchctl getenv PATH` # check if has not already patched if [[ $OLD_GUI_PATH != *$ADDITIONAL_PATH* ]] then NEW_GUI_PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$OLD_GUI_PATH launchctl setenv PATH $NEW_GUI_PATH fi Looks like a little bit cumbersome, but works ! If there is easier way, i would be glad to know.\nUpdate: There is problem with this solution. launchctl settings are updated during first load of .profile file. So if you has not opened terminal app yes (for example after restart), you cant use this customization.\nUpdated solution can be found here.\n","id":570,"section":"posts","summary":"Suppose you install some program into your home directory (i had installed mercurial from source). To use it you have to patch PATH variable.\nTo achieve this, you needed to modify, for example, local .profile file (its undesirable to modify global config like etc/profile). So your .profile file contains something like this:\nexport PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH It wokrs great from terminal. But you cant use variable defined such way from programs launched throught spotlight, because all apps started from gui interface of Mac Os has its own list of environemnt variables (independent from terminal).","tags":null,"title":"Mac os environment variables","uri":"https://yantonov.com/2014/10/2014-10-27-mac-os-environment-variables/","year":"2014"},{"content":"hello world :-)\n","id":571,"section":"posts","summary":"hello world :-)","tags":null,"title":"Hello world","uri":"https://yantonov.com/2014/10/2014-10-27-hello-world/","year":"2014"}],"tags":[{"title":"algorithm","uri":"https://yantonov.com/tags/algorithm/"},{"title":"consensus","uri":"https://yantonov.com/tags/consensus/"},{"title":"css","uri":"https://yantonov.com/tags/css/"},{"title":"deploy","uri":"https://yantonov.com/tags/deploy/"},{"title":"distributed systems","uri":"https://yantonov.com/tags/distributed-systems/"},{"title":"paxos","uri":"https://yantonov.com/tags/paxos/"},{"title":"rust","uri":"https://yantonov.com/tags/rust/"}]}
