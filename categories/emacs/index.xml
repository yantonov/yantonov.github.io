      <description>Some time ago i read excellent post about emacs library pcomplete.
The author described implementation of completion for git, mercurial version control system using this library. Article is really usefull, i used code as is, its easy and provides all you need, but later i have some problem with it.
First problem - eager evaluation. General commands for git and mercurial are calculated once. Great, there is no reason to call external process like git or hg multiple times but precalculation occured at script evaluation.</description>
