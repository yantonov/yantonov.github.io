      <description>Foreword:
Sometimes you need to edit PATH variable.
Of course you edit .bash_profile, .bashrc, .profile or other scripts and this works fine only in terminal.
GUI apps at Mac Os use its own PATH variable (moreover has its own environment), which can be set using &amp;lsquo;launchctl setenv PATH &amp;rsquo;.
So you need to setup PATH for GUI apps correctly, and do not forget about PATH var for terminal.
Moreover, after update to Mac Os X 10.</description>

      <description>Suppose you install some program into your home directory (i had installed mercurial from source). To use it you have to patch PATH variable.
To achieve this, you needed to modify, for example, local .profile file (its undesirable to modify global config like etc/profile). So your .profile file contains something like this:
export PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH  It wokrs great from terminal. But you cant use variable defined such way from programs launched throught spotlight, because all apps started from gui interface of Mac Os has its own list of environemnt variables (independent from terminal).</description>
