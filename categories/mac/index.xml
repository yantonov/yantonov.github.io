      <description>During matplotlib installation (for python3) some error may occured:
&amp;lsquo;The following required packages can not be built:
* freetype
* png&amp;rsquo;
Thats why some additional steps may be required:
 install homebrew
 install pkg-config
brew install pkg-config  install freetype
brew install freetype  install matplotlib
pip3 install matplotlib   Enjoy!</description>

      <description>Sometimes you may want to delete some package (*.pkg) from your Mac OS installaction. Its assumed, you dont have uninstaller.
There is no official way to uninstall package, but you can do it manually using &amp;lsquo;pkgutil&amp;rsquo; tool. There is some articles (you can google it) which described the process.
To automate the process i have wrote this script uninstall-pkg.sh
#!/bin/sh # this script allow you to uninstall given pkg file # ATTENTIONS!</description>

      <title>PATH variable for gui programs (Mac Os)</title>

      <description>Foreword:
Sometimes you need to edit PATH variable.
Of course you edit .bash_profile, .bashrc, .profile or other scripts and this works fine only in terminal.
GUI apps at Mac Os use its own PATH variable (moreover has its own environment), which can be set using &amp;lsquo;launchctl setenv PATH &amp;rsquo;.
So you need to setup PATH for GUI apps correctly, and do not forget about PATH var for terminal.
Moreover, after update to Mac Os X 10.</description>

      <description>Suppose you install some program into your home directory (i had installed mercurial from source). To use it you have to patch PATH variable.
To achieve this, you needed to modify, for example, local .profile file (its undesirable to modify global config like etc/profile). So your .profile file contains something like this:
export PATH=$ADDITIONAL_PATH:$PATH  It wokrs great from terminal. But you cant use variable defined such way from programs launched throught spotlight, because all apps started from gui interface of Mac Os has its own list of environemnt variables (independent from terminal).</description>
